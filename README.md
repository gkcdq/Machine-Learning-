# RLP

_This project has been created as a personal project_

_Project developed to study on autonomous agents and reinforcement learning decision-making._

# 🤖 RLP: Reinforcement Learning & Pathfinding

RLP is an experimental visualization platform for __Reinforcement Learning__ integrated into an interactive grid environment. The goal is to train an agent to collect items and reach an exit optimally using modern __AI algorithms__.

## 🔄 Decision Cycle (RL Loop)

The agent operates within a continuous feedback loop, learning to map environmental states to optimal actions.

### How it works in RLP:
1.  **Observation (State)**: The agent identifies its current coordinates `(r, c)` and the current collection phase based on the optimal TSP order.

2.  **Action Selection**: Using an **Epsilon-Greedy** policy, the agent either explores randomly or exploits known paths from the Q-Tables (`qTableA` & `qTableB`).

3.  **Environment Feedback**:
    * **Positive Reward**: Collecting an item (+300) or reaching the exit (+1000).
    * **Negative Reward**: Hitting a wall (-15) or repetitive / stagnant movement.

4.  **Learning**: The agent updates its internal knowledge using **Double Q-Learning** and **Experience Replay** to stabilize the learning process.

# 🚀 Features

- Dynamic Map Editor: Draw `walls`, place `collectibles`, and define `start` / `exit` points in real-time.

- Reinforcement Learning Engine: Full implementation of Double Q-Learning with experience replay memory.

- Hybrid Pathfinding: Uses BFS (Breadth-First Search) for distance calculation and reward optimization.

_Double Heatmap Visualization:_

- __Green__ (Q-Values): Visualizes the AI's "instinct" (what it "thinks" is the best path).

- __Red__ (Frequency): Visualizes experience (the most explored areas).

# 🧠 Learning Concepts (RL)

The agent learns through trial and error. It receives rewards (positive or negative) based on its actions.
#### 1. Double Q-Learning

- To prevent the overestimation of reward values, the project uses two Q-tables (qTableA and qTableB).

- The agent chooses an action with one table.

- It updates the value using the second table to evaluate the next state.

##### Formula used:
```bash
Qtarget ​= R + γ ⋅ Qeval​(s′ ,argmax Qupdate​(s′ ,a′))
```
#### 2. Experience Replay (Memory)

The project stores past transitions in a replayBuffer. At each step, the AI "replays" a sample of 64 past transitions to stabilize its learning and prevent forgetting older paths.
#### 3. Reward Shaping (Reward Modeling)

The reward system is finely tuned to guide the agent:

`Collection`: +300

`Exit` (if ready): +1000

`Wall Collision`: −15

`Stagnation` / `Back-and-forth`: Progressive penalties to force exploration.

# 🛤️ Pathfinding & Optimization

The AI does not simply walk at random; it utilizes graph theory algorithms to assist itself:

- BFS (Breadth-First Search): Used to pre-calculate real distances between all points of interest (Start, Collectibles, Exit) by ignoring walls.

- Nearest-Neighbor TSP: The AI calculates an optimal collection order before starting to structure its learning phases.

- Map Validation: An algorithm verifies that the exit and collectibles are not isolated by walls before launching the simulation.

# 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Frontend: React.js, TypeScript.

- Styling: CSS-in-JS with dynamic CSS variables for the heatmap.

- Build Tool: Vite.

- Environment: Docker & Nginx.

# 📖 Installation

-  __Prerequisites__

-  Docker >= 24.0
-  Docker Compose >= 2.0
-  Git

- __Configuration__ (.env)

- Create a .env file at the root of the project:
```bash
# Nginx / Domain
DOMAIN_NAME=example
```
- Clone the repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rlp.git
```
- Go to the root of the project:
```Bash
make
```
- Access: Go to http://localhost:8080.

# 🕹️ How to use?

- Draw _walls_ (Wall tool █).
- Place _collectibles_ (◈) and an exit (⬡).
- Define the _start_ (◉).
- Press `START`: Watch the AI explore (Exploration phase with Epsilon-Greedy) then optimize its path as cells turn green.
